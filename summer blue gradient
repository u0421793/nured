<title>Summer Blue Gradient</title>

You’ll always remember this summer
From upmost darkest of nothing 
down to remnant of something
Graded faded graduate to gradient 

You’ll always respond to blue
The richness of velvety royal
Download confidence of icons
Maximum brightness cyan

The pale of the edge of sky
The miraculous blending to blue
The unachievable smooth transition
No stepping or tonal quantisation

The summer is fading
Summer blue hopes
The seasons are going
Summer blue fades
The career decomposing
Summer blue serious
The hopes disconnecting
Summer blue gradient

Now that we’ve invested, saving up for love
And comfortable enjoyment in colder evenings
The direction is clear, the work has been done
The wheel is in motion of orbital trajectory
