# nured

1. texpladia development again - get something back, gif compositing, sequencing, titling, at the least
2. AmbiX and A-frame and panoramas - also try ambi circuit mixes


It is now clear that minority of the experiments are going to be here, most of the rest stays on my own git server

Need to make room for brown box - new project.

don't use codepen any more for the a-frame stuff, use local like everything else.
built the prototype model offline first

the model has no visual identity. Need to sort this out, as it seems to be holding up progress
